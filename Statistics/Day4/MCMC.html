This module works through an example of the use of Markov chain
Monte Carlo for drawing samples from a multidimensional distribution
and estimating expectations with respect to this distribution. The
algorithms used to draw the samples is generally refered to as the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm of which the Gibbs sampler is a special
case. We describe a model that is easy to specify but requires samples
from a relatively complicated distribution for which classical Monte
Carlo sampling methods are impractical. We describe how to implement a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for this example. <br><br>

The purpose of this is twofold: First to illustrate how MCMC
algorithms are easy to implement (at least in principle) in situations
where classical Monte Carlo methods do not work and second to provide
a glimpse of practical MCMC implementation issues. It is difficult to
work through a truly complex example of a Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm in a short tutorial. Our example is therefore necessarily
simple but working through it should provide a beginning MCMC user a
taste for how to implement an MCMC procedure for a problem where
classical Monte Carlo methods are unusable.

Introduction </span></small></span></span></big></big><br> <br> 

<b> Monte Carlo </b> methods are a collection of techniques that use
pseudo-random (computer simulated) values to approximate solutions to
mathematical problems.  In this tutorial, we will focus on using Monte
Carlo for Bayesian inference. In particular, we will use it for the
evaluation of expectations with respect to a probability
distribution. Monte Carlo methods can also be used for a variety of
other purposes, including estimating maxima or minima of functions (as
in likelihood-based inference) but we will not discuss these here.
<br> <br>

Monte Carlo works as follows: Suppose we want to estimate an
expectation of a function g(x) with respect to the probability
distribution f. We denote this desired quantity m= E<sub> f
</sub>g(x). Often, m is analytically intractable (the integration or
summation required is too complicated). A Monte Carlo estimate of m is
obtained by simulating N pseudo-random values from the distribution f,
say X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>,..,X<sub>N</sub> and simply taking the
average of g(X<sub>1</sub>),g(X<sub>2</sub>),..,g(X<sub>N</sub>) to
estimate m. As N (number of samples) gets large, the estimate
converges to the true expectation m.  <br>

A toy example to calculate the P(-1&lt; X
&lt; 0) when X is a Normal(0,1) random variable: <br>
 <b> xs = rnorm(10000) # simulate 10,000 draws from N(0,1) </b> <br>
 <b> xcount = sum((xs&gt;-1) &amp; (xs&lt;0)) # count number of draws between -1 and 0 </b> <br>
 <b> xcount/10000 # Monte Carlo estimate of probability </b> <br>
 <b> pnorm(0)-pnorm(-1) # Compare it to R's answer (cdf at 0) - (cdf at -1) </b> 
<br><br>

<b> Importance sampling: </b> Another powerful technique for
  estimating expectations is importance sampling where we produce
  draws from a different distribution, say q, and compute a specific
  weighted average of these draws to obtain estimates of expectations
  with respect to f. In this case, A Monte Carlo estimate of m is
  obtained by simulating N pseudo-random values from the distribution
  q, say Y<sub>1</sub>,Y<sub>2</sub>,..,Y<sub>N</sub> and simply
  taking the average of g(Y<sub>1</sub>)w(Y<sub>1</sub>)
  ,g(Y<sub>2</sub>)w(Y<sub>1</sub>),..,g(Y<sub>N</sub>)w(Y<sub>1</sub>)
  to estimate m, where W<sub>1</sub>,W<sub>2</sub>,..,W<sub>N</sub>
  are weights obtained as follows: W<sub>i</sub> =
  f(Y<sub>1</sub>)/q(Y<sub>1</sub>). As N (number of samples) gets
  large, the estimate converges to the true expectation m. Often, when
  normalizing constants for f or q are unknown, and for numerical
  stability, the weights are `normalized' by dividing the above
  weights by the sum of all weights (sum over
  W<sub>1</sub>,..,W<sub>N</sub>).
<br>

Importance sampling is powerful in a number of situations, including:
<br> (i) When expectations with respect to several different
distributions (say f<sub>1</sub>,..,f<sub>p</sub>) are of
interest. All these expectations can, in principle, be estimated by
using just a single set of samples!  <br> (ii) When rare event
probabilities are of interest so ordinary Monte Carlo would take a
huge number of samples for accurate estimates. In such cases,
selecting q appropriately can produce much more accurate estimates
with far fewer samples.

<br> <br>

Discussions of importance sampling in astronomical Bayesian
computation appear in <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0205436"> Lewis &amp; Bridle </a>
and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4089"> Trotta </a> for
cosmological parameter estimation and <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0512634"> Ford </a> for
extrasolar planet modeling.

<br><br>

R has random number generators for most standard distributions and
there are many more general algorithms (such as rejection sampling)
for producing independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draws
from f. Another, very general approach for producing non i.i.d. draws
(approximately) from f is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.


<br> <br>
<b>  Markov chain Monte Carlo </b>: For complicated distributions,
producing pseudo-random i.i.d. draws from f is often infeasible. In
such cases, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to produce a
Markov chain say X<sub>1</sub>,X<sub>2</sub>,..,X<sub>N</sub> where
the X<sub>i</sub>'s are
<i> dependent </i> draws that are <i> approximately </i> from the
desired distribution. As before, the average of
g(X<sub>1</sub>),g(X<sub>2</sub>),..,g(X<sub>N</sub>) is an estimate
that converges to m as N gets large. The
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is very general and hence very
useful. In the following example we will see how it can be used for
inference for a model/problem where it would otherwise be impossible
to compute desired expectations.

Problem and model description
</span></small></span></span></big></big><br> <br> 

<b> First,  a five minute review of Bayesian inference </b> <br>

We begin by specifying a probability model for our data Y by assuming
it is generated from some distribution h(theta;Y), where theta is a
set of parameters for that distribution.  This is written Y~h(theta).
We want to infer theta from the fixed, observed dataset Y.  First,
consider likelihood inference.  We find a value of theta where the
likelihood L(theta;Y) (which is obtained from the probability
distribution h(theta;Y)) is maximized; this is the maximum likelihood
estimate (MLE) for theta.  Now consider Bayesian inference.  We assume
a prior distribution for theta, p(theta), based on our previous
knowledge.  This prior may be based on astrophysical insights (e.g. no
source can have negative brightness), past astronomical observation
(e.g. stars have masses between 0.08-150 solar masses), and/or
statistical considerations (e.g. uniform or Jeffreys priors) when it
is difficult to obtain good prior information.  Inference is based on
the posterior distribution Pi(theta|Y) which is proportional to the
product of the likelihood and the prior. It is only <em> proportional
</em> to this product because in reality Bayes theory requires that we
write down a denominator (the integral of the product of the
likelihood and prior over the parameter space).  Fortunately, Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithms avoid computation of this denominator
while still producing samples from the posterior Pi(theta| Y). Note
that the MCMC methods discussed here are often associated with
Bayesian computation, but are really independent methods which can be
used for a variety of challenging numerical problems. Essentially, any
time samples from a complicated distribution are needed, MCMC may be
useful.

<br> <br>


Our example uses a
dataset from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP). 

This is a time series of X-ray emission from a flaring young star in the Orion Nebula Cluster.

More
information on this is available at: <a href="http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/datasets/Chandra_flares.html">
CASt Chandra Flares data set </a>.

The raw data, which arrives approximately according to a Poisson
process, gives the individual photon arrival times (in seconds) and
their energies (in keV). The processed data we consider here is
obtained by grouping the events into evenly-spaced time bins (10,000
seconds width). <br> <br>

Our goal for this data analysis is to identify the change point and
estimate the intensities of the Poisson process before and after the
change point.

We describe a Bayesian model for this change point problem (Carlin
and Louis, 2000). Let Yt be the number of occurrences of some event at
time t. The process is observed for times 1 through n and we assume
that there is a change at time k, i.e., after time k, the event counts
are significantly different (higher or lower than before). The
mathematical description of the model is provided in <a href="http://personal.psu.edu/muh10/MCMCtut/chptmodel2021.pdf"> change point model (pdf)
</a>. While this is a simple model, it is adequate for illustrating
some basic principles for constructing an MCMC algorithm.

<br><br>
We first read in the data:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">chptdat = read.table("http://personal.psu.edu/muh10/MCMCtut/COUP551_rates.dat",skip=1)
</span><br>
<i> Note: This data set is just a convenient subset of the actual data set (see reference below.)</i> <br> <br>
We can begin with a simple time series plot as exploratory
analysis. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Y=chptdat[,2] # store data in Y</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">ts.plot(Y,main="Time series plot of change point data")</span><br>
The plot suggests that the change point may be around 10.

<br> 

Setting up the MCMC algorithm <br>
</span></small></span></span></big></big><br> Our goal is to simulate
multiple draws from the posterior distribution which is a
multidimensional distribution known only upto a (normalizing)
constant. From this multidimensional distribution, we can easily
derive the conditional distribution of each of the individual
parameters (one dimension at a time). This is described, along with
 a description of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in <a href="http://personal.psu.edu/muh10/MCMCtut/fullcond2021.pdf"> full conditional distributions and M-H algorithm (pdf) </a>.

<!-- We will need an editor for our program. For instance, we can use -->
<!-- Wordpad (available under the Start button menu under -->
<!-- Accessories). Ideally, a more `intelligent' editor such as emacs (with -->
<!-- ESS or emacs speaks statistics installed) should be used to edit R -->
<!-- programs. -->

<br>

Please save code from
<a href="http://personal.psu.edu/muh10/MCMCtut/MCMCchpt.R"> MCMC template in R</a> into a file and open this
file using the editor. Save this file as MCMCchpt.R  <br> <br>
Source this file for MCMC diagnostics (this will be useful later) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"> source("http://personal.psu.edu/muh10/MCMCtut/batchmeans.R")
</span><br>


Note that in this version of the code, all parameters are sampled except for k (which is fixed at our guessed change point).<br>
To load the program from the file MCMCchpt.R we use the "source" command. (Reminder: It may be helpful to type: <b> setwd("V:/") </b> to set the default directory to the place where you can save your files) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"> source("MCMCchpt.R") # with appropriate filepathname
</span>
<br> We can now run the MCMC algorithm:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"> mchain &lt;- mhsampler(NUMIT=1000,dat=Y) # call the function with appropriate arguments
</span> <br>

MCMC output analysis
</span></small></span></span></big></big><br> <br>

Now that we have output from our sampler, we can treat these
samples as data from which we can estimate quantities of
interest. For instance, to estimate the expectation of a marginal
distribution for a particular parameter, we would simply average all
draws for that parameter so to obtain an estimate of E(theta):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">mean(mchain[1,]) # obtain mean of first row (thetas) </span><br>
To get estimates for means for all parameters:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">apply(mchain,1,mean) # compute means by row (for all parameters at once)</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">apply(mchain,1,median) # compute medians by row (for all parameters at once)</span><br>
To obtain an estimate of the entire posterior distribution: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">plot(density(mchain[1,]),main="smoothed density plot for theta posterior")</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">plot(density(mchain[2,]),main="smoothed density plot for lambda posterior")</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">hist(mchain[3,],main="histogram for k posterior")</span><br>
To find the (posterior) probability that lambda is greater than 10 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">sum(mchain[2,]&gt;10)/length(mchain[2,])</span><br><br>

Now comment the line that fixes k at our guess (add the # mark) :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"> # currk &lt;- KGUESS </span><br><br>

Rerun the sampler with k also sampled. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"> mchain &lt;- mhsampler(NUMIT=1000,dat=Y) 
</span> <br><br>
With the new output, you
can repeat the calculations above (finding means, plotting density
estimates etc.) <br>
<br>
You can also study how your estimate for the expectation of the posterior distribution for k changes with each iteration.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"> estvssamp(mchain[3,]) </span><br><br>

We would like to assess whether our Markov chain is moving around
quickly enough to produce good estimates (this property is often
called 'good mixing'). While this is in general difficult to do
rigorously,
<u> estimates of the autocorrelation </u> in the samples is an informal but
useful check. To obtain sample autocorrelations we use the acf plot function:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">acf(mchain[1,],main="acf plot for theta")</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">acf(mchain[2,],main="acf plot for lambda")</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">acf(mchain[3,],main="acf plot for k")</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">acf(mchain[4,],main="acf plot for b1")</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">acf(mchain[5,],main="acf plot for b2")</span><br><br>

If the samples are heavily autocorrelated we should rethink our
sampling scheme or, at the very least, run the chain for much
longer. Note that the autocorrelations are negligible for all
parameters except k which is heavily autocorrelated. This is easily
resolved for this example since the sampler is fast (we can run the
chain much longer very easily). In problems where producing additional
samples is more time consuming, such as complicated high dimensional
problems, improving the sampler `mixing' can be much more critical. <br> <br>

Why are there such strong autocorrelations for k? The acceptance rate
for k proposals (printed out with each MCMC run) are well below 10%
which suggests that k values are stagnant more than 90% of the time. A
better proposal for the Metropolis-Hastings update of a parameter can
help improve acceptance rates which often, in turn, reduces
autocorrelations. Try another proposal for k and see how it affects
autocorrelations. In complicated problems, carefully constructed
proposals can have a major impact on the efficiency of the MCMC
algorithm.
<br><br>

<u> How do we choose starting values?</u> In general, any value we
believe would be reasonable under the posterior distribution will
suffice. You can experiment with different starting values. For
instance: modify the starting value for k in the function (for
instance, try setting k=10), "source" the function in R and run the
sampler again as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"> mchain2 &lt;- mhsampler(NUMIT=1000,dat=Y)</span><br>
You can study how your estimate for the expectation of the posterior distribution for k changes with each iteration.
<br>

<br> <big><big><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">
 Assessing accuracy and determining chain length
 </span></small></span></span></big></big><br> <br> There are two
 important issues to consider when we have draws from an MCMC
 algorithm: (1) how do we assess the accuracy of our estimates based
 on the sample (how do we compute Monte Carlo standard errors?) (2)
 how long do we run the chain before we feel confident that our
 results are reasonably accurate ? <br> <br>

Regarding (1): Computing standard errors for a Monte Carlo estimate for
 an i.i.d. (classical Monte Carlo) sampler is easy, as shown for the
 toy example on estimating P(-1&lt; X &lt; 0) when X is a Normal(0,1) random
 variable. Simply obtain the sample standard deviation of the g(xi)
 values and divide by square root of n (the number of samples). Since
 Markov chains produce dependent draws, computing precise Monte Carlo
 standard errors for such samplers is a very difficult problem in
 general. For (2): Draws produced by classical Monte Carlo methods
 (such as rejection sampling) produced draws from the correct
 distribution. The MCMC algorithm produces draws that are
 asymptotically from the correct distribution. All the draws we see
 after a finite number of iterations are therefore only approximately
 from the correct distribution. Determining how long we have to run
 the chain before we feel sufficiently confident that the MCMC
 algorithm has produced reasonably accurate draws from the
 distribution is therefore a very difficult problem. Most rigorous
 solutions are too specific or tailored towards relatively simple
 situations while more general approaches tend to be heuristic.
 <br><br>

There are many ways to compute Monte Carlo standard errors.  Two simple but reasonable ways
of calculating it: <a href="http://personal.psu.edu/muh10/MCMCtut/batchmeans.R"> the consistent batch means
(bm) and the iterated monotone sequence estimator (imse) method in R.
</a>

Carlo: Can we trust the third significant figure?

<!--  and <a href="batchmeans.pdf">  a brief description (pdf) </a>.  -->
<br> <br>

To compute MC s.error via batch means, download the bm
function from the batchmeans.R file above and source the file into
R. We can now calculate standard error estimates for each of the five
parameter estimates:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">bm(mchain[1,])</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">bm(mchain[2,])</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">bm(mchain[3,])</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">bm(mchain[4,])</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">bm(mchain[5,])</span><br><br>

Are these standard errors acceptable ? <br><br>

There is a vast literature on different proposals for dealing with the
latter issue (how long to run the chain) but they are all heuristics
at best. The links at the bottom of this page (see section titled
"Some resources") provide references to learn more about suggested
solutions. One method that is fairly simple, theoretically justified
in some cases and seems to work reasonably well in practice is as
follows: run the MCMC algorithm and periodically
compute Monte Carlo standard errors. Once the Monte Carlo standard
errors are below some (user-defined) threshold, stop the
simulation.
<br> <br>
Often MCMC users do not run their simulations long enough. For
 complicated problems run lengths in the millions (or more) are
 typically suggested (although this may not always be feasible). For
 our example run the MCMC algorithm again, this time for 100000
 iterations (set NUMIT=100000).  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;"> mchain2 &lt;-
 mhsampler(NUMIT=100000,dat=Y)</span><br><br>

You can now obtain estimates of the posterior
 distribution of the parameters as before and compute the new Monte
 Carlo standard error. Note whether the estimates and corresponding MC
 standard error have changed with respect to the previous sampler.

Making changes to the model
</span></small></span></span></big></big><br> <br>

<!-- If we were to change the prior distributions on some of the individual -->
<!-- parameters, only relatively minor changes may be needed in the -->
<!-- program. For instance if the Inverse Gamma prior on b1 and b2 were -->
<!-- replaced by Gamma(0.01,100) priors on them, we would only have to -->
<!-- change the lines in the code corresponding to the updates of b1 and b2 -->
<!-- (we would need to perform a Metropolis-Hastings update of each -->
<!-- parameter). The rest of the code would remain unchanged. Modifying the -->
<!-- program to make it sample from the posterior for the <a -->
<!-- href="chptmodel2.pdf"> modified model </a> is a useful exercise. For -->
<!-- the modified full conditionals see <a href="fullcond2.pdf"> modified -->
<!-- full conditional distributions. </a> -->
<!-- <br> <br> -->

If we wanted to add more flexibility, we could replace the fixed value
of b1 and b2 by placing priors on them and simply adding them to the
MCMC algorithm -- b1 and b2 would be sampled in addition to the other
parameters. The conditional updates for the other parameter would
remain essentially the same, except they would use the most updated
value of b1 and b2 from the algorithm rather than a fixed value at
each iteration.

An obvious modification to this model would be to allow for more than
one change point, leading to more changepoint parameters (e.g. k1 and
k2 if there are two changepoints) and parameters corresponding to the
distribution of the Poisson random variable during each period
(e.g. theta, lambda, nu). A very sophisticated model that may be
useful in many change point problems is one where the number of change
points is also treated as unknown. In this case the <i>number</i> of
Poisson parameters (only two of them in our example: theta and lambda)
is also unknown. The posterior distribution is then a mixture over
distributions of varying dimensions (the dimensions change with the
number of change points in the model). This requires an advanced
version of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm known as <b>
reversible-jump Metropolis Hastings</b> due to Peter Green (<em>
Biometrika, 1995 </em>).<!-- Some -->
